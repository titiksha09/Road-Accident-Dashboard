🚦 Road Accident Dashboard
📖 Story Behind the Dashboard

Every number tells a story.
Behind each accident, there’s a life impacted, a family waiting, and a community concerned. When we look at road accident data, it’s not just about statistics—it’s about uncovering patterns, finding causes, and preventing future tragedies.

This dashboard was built to bring those hidden insights to light. By transforming raw accident data into a visual story, we can start asking the right questions:

Why do more accidents happen on certain road surfaces?

Does the weather really play a role in fatal casualties?

Which vehicle types are more vulnerable?

How safe are our roads across different regions?

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze road accident trends and provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and everyday citizens.

By presenting the data visually, the dashboard allows us to:

📉 Track accident trends over time

🚗 Understand the impact of different vehicles

🌧 Analyze the effect of weather conditions

🛣 Compare road types and surfaces

📍 Pinpoint high-risk locations on the map

📊 Dashboard Highlights

Total Accidents & Casualties – Overall trends with year-over-year comparison

Fatal Casualties by Vehicle – See which vehicles are most involved in fatal accidents

Weather Conditions Impact – Rain, snow, frost, or fine weather—how each plays a role

Road Types & Surfaces – Which road conditions are most dangerous

Geographical Distribution – A live map showing accident hotspots across the UK

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Tableau – For building the interactive dashboard

Excel / CSV dataset – Source of raw accident data

Mapbox Integration – For mapping accident locations

💡 Key Insights

🚗 Cars account for the majority of fatal casualties, though decreasing compared to previous years

🌧 Nearly 14% of accidents occur during rainy weather, highlighting the importance of road safety campaigns in wet conditions

🛣 Single carriageways are the most accident-prone road surfaces, with over 77% of fatal casualties happening here

📍 Certain UK regions consistently show higher accident densities—indicating the need for focused road safety measures

🚀 Future Enhancements

Adding interactive filters for time of day and age groups

Predictive analysis using Machine Learning to forecast accident hotspots

Integration with real-time traffic and weather APIs
